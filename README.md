# MLFoundation-Linear-Regression
**Bike sharing analysis**

Dataset: Please use the day.csv dataset which was given to you in the second class, within the bike sharing dataset. 
Also refer to the readme file to understand the features. 

Task: Carry out multiple regression (linear) using Scikit learn library) to predict the daily count (cnt). You must address following issues:

Feature Engineering: Identify the features relevant for multiple linear regression. Please do not include any feature which is not compatible with linear regression
Develop new features wherever possible to improve the prediction

Visualization: Plot distribution and box plot for “temp”, “hum”,”windspeed” and “Casual” . Use matplotlib library. 

Assumptions: Please check whether the data fulfills all the linear regression assumption. Carry out necessary data transformation if required

Evaluation: Evaluate your model by measuring mean squared error
